Latency Cores (CPU)
throughput cores (GPU) - Maximise the amount of throuhgput (Effecient)

CPU uArch - Sequential, data forwarding, branch prediction to reuce branach latency, Larger caches


GPU uArch - Parallel

Libraries:
	- easy to use, without in depth PL knowledge
	- Drop in
	- quality
	
	
GPU - global memory is part of the DRAM (VRAM) (Each block has a certain number of threads. Each grid contains blocks. )

(MUST BE DONE EACH TIME)
mkdir build --> create a makeDir build		
cmake .. -> calls the cmake
make -> builds

./build.VetorAdd -i "Path to input0.raw","path to input1.raw" -o output.raw -e "path to output.raw"

wbimport( used to import data from a file)

__WB_H__ -> will need to recompile it (wb.h)
